The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue where a seemingly correct selector fails to apply styles to an element. This is particularly problematic because the selector seems logically correct, making it harder to debug.  The problem arises from the specificity of the selector and the way CSS cascading works. 
```css
#container {
  width: 500px;
  height: 300px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#container .box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
In this example, the `#container .box` selector should ideally override the `.box` selector when the `.box` element is nested within the `#container` element. However, depending on the context and other CSS rules, the more generic `.box` selector might still apply, leading to unexpected results. This is especially true if more specific rules are loaded later in the stylesheet.
